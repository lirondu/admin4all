#NOTE:
this software is not meant from public usage, meaning, it's not built as a frame-work or easy to integrate software.<br>
but feel free to try...<br>
I will try to keep the README updated... Good Luck :)<br>

#Description:
**admin4all** is generic system to help build express websites.<br>
The goal was to have the common parts between websites as a closed system, so building new sites doesn't require copy from a previous site but build it on top of a *base system*.<br>
Using **admin4all** while building a new website allows to concentrate on the site itself and **only**!

<br>

#What are the *common parts*?
- database
- editable text
- editable text complex (rich editor)
- editable list (select box)
- editable picture (browse)

- thumbnails generator
