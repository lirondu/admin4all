#NOTE:
this software is not meant from public usage, meaning it's not built as a frame-work or easy to integrate software.<br>
but feel free to try...<br>
I will try to keep the README updated... Good Luck :)<br>

#Description:
**admin4all** is generic system to help build express websites.
The goal was to have the common parts between websites as a closed system, so building new sites is not copy paste from the old site and then modify the relevant.
Using **admin4all**, building a new website, should concentrate on the site itself and **only**!

<br>

#What are the *common parts*?
- database
- editable text
- editable text complex (rich editor)
- editable list (select box)
- editable picture (browse)
- grid editor
- gallery editor
- pages / tables manage
- file manager
- thumbnails generator
